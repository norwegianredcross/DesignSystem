# Theme Switching Fixes - 2025-04-03

## Changes Made

1. Removed conflicting theme imports from:
   - `app.tsx`
   - `components/showcase-page.tsx`

2. Improved theme switching logic in `showcase-page.tsx`:
   - More precise removal of existing theme stylesheets
   - Added console logging for debugging
   - Ensured proper CSS cascade by appending at end of head
   - Fixed theme path references to use absolute paths

3. Verified theme files exist in:
   - `public/design-tokens-build/brand-1.css`
   - `public/design-tokens-build/brand-2.css`

## How Theme Switching Works

- Clicking the "Switch Theme" button toggles between brand-1 and brand-2 themes
- The current theme is tracked in component state
- Data attributes are updated on the document element
- Console logs show the switching process for debugging
