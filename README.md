## Overview

Welcome to the Røde Kors Design System! This repository contains a library of reusable UI components built with React, specifically tailored for Norwegian Red Cross digital projects.

It's developed leveraging the foundational components from Digdir's Designsystemet. This approach ensures a unified and recognizable visual identity across all applications for the Norwegian Red Cross. The system is pre-configured with the official Røde Kors brand theme, which is provided via a dedicated design token package.

The primary goal is to ensure brand consistency, improve development efficiency, and maintain high accessibility standards across all Røde Kors applications.

Storybook serves as the interactive documentation and development environment for viewing and testing these components.

## Consuming This Library (For Application Developers)

To use the Røde Kors Design System in your Next.js (or any React) application:

### 1. Installation

Install the necessary npm packages for your project. You will need three packages: the component library itself (`rk-designsystem`), the base styles from Digdir, and the Røde Kors theme package (`rk-design-tokens`).

```bash
# npm
npm install rk-designsystem @digdir/designsystemet-css rk-design-tokens

# yarn
yarn add rk-designsystem @digdir/designsystemet-css rk-design-tokens

# pnpm
pnpm add rk-designsystem @digdir/designsystemet-css rk-design-tokens
```

**Note:** You do not need to install `@digdir/designsystemet-react` separately, as all required components are included within the `rk-designsystem` package.

### 2. Including Styles (CSS)

For the components to be styled correctly, you must import the stylesheets at the highest level of your application, for instance, in your `layout.tsx` (for Next.js App Router) or `_app.tsx` (for Next.js Pages Router).

**Crucial Order:** It's vital that the base stylesheet (`@digdir/designsystemet-css`) is loaded **before** the Røde Kors theme file (`rk-design-tokens`). This ensures our theme's tokens can correctly override the default values.

#### Example for Next.js (App Router - `src/app/layout.tsx`):

```tsx
import './globals.css'; // Your own global styles (if any)
import '@digdir/designsystemet-css/index.css'; // Base stylesheet for components
import 'rk-design-tokens/design-tokens-build/brand-1.css'; // Røde Kors theme

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

#### Example for Next.js (Pages Router - `pages/_app.tsx`):

```tsx
import '../styles/globals.css'; // Your own global styles (if any)
import '@digdir/designsystemet-css/index.css'; // Base stylesheet for components
import 'rk-design-tokens/design-tokens-build/brand-1.css'; // Røde Kors theme
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

### 3. Using Components

Once the stylesheets are included, you can start importing and using components in your project. All components you need are available directly from the `rk-designsystem` package.

#### 3.1 Import and Use Røde Kors Design System Components

Import components directly from the `rk-designsystem` package:

```tsx
import { Alert } from 'rk-designsystem'; // Import necessary components

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <Alert variant="info" onClose={() => console.log('Alert closed!')}>
        This is an informational message from the Red Cross Design System.
      </Alert>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### 3.2 Example Usage in a Next.js Page

Here's an example of how to use multiple Alert components from the Røde Kors Design System within a Next.js page/component:

```tsx
'use client'; // Remember 'use client' for interactive components in App Router

import React from 'react';
import { Alert } from 'rk-designsystem'; // Import the components you need

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto p-8">
      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">
        Røde Kors Design System Example
      </h1>

      <section>
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Alerts</h2>
        {/* Røde Kors Design System Alerts */}
        <Alert variant="success">
          <p>
            Welcome! This message is styled with the official Røde Kors theme.
          </p>
        </Alert>

        <Alert variant="warning" className="mt-4">
          <p>
            Important information using the official Røde Kors theme.
          </p>
        </Alert>
      </section>

      {/* More Røde Kors components can be added here as needed */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The appearance of all components is fully controlled by the `rk-design-tokens` package. To receive any visual updates to the brand theme (like a new primary color), simply update the package to its latest version:

```bash
npm update rk-design-tokens
```

# Contributing to the Component Library

This guide provides a set of standards and best practices for creating new components. Following these guidelines ensures that our component library remains consistent, accessible, and easy to maintain.

## Getting Started (for Contributors)

Follow these steps to get the local development environment running. All commands should be run from the root of the project.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Build all packages
pnpm build

# 3. Start the local Storybook server
pnpm storybook
```

## Core Principles

Every component we build should adhere to these core principles:

1.  **Accessibility (A11y):** Components must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. This means proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and semantic HTML.
2.  **Reusability:** Components should be generic enough to be used in multiple contexts without modification.
3.  **Consistency:** Components should follow our established design tokens (colors, spacing, typography) and have a consistent API and structure.
4.  **Documentation:** Every component must be documented in Storybook to make it discoverable and easy for other developers to use.

## When to Create a New Component

Before you start coding, determine what kind of component you need. Most of our needs fall into one of three categories:

1.  **Wrapped Component (Simple):**
    *   **What it is:** A component that directly wraps and re-exports a component from `@digdir/designsystemet-react` with no modifications.
    *   **When to use:** When the base Digdir component meets our needs perfectly, but we want to include it in our own library for a consistent import source.
    *   **Example:** The `Buttons` component is a perfect example of this.

2.  **Wrapped Component (with Style Overrides):**
    *   **What it is:** A wrapped Digdir component where we apply custom CSS to tweak its appearance to better match Røde Kors's specific design language.
    *   **When to use:** When a Digdir component is functionally correct but needs visual adjustments (e.g., different icons, border radius, padding).
    *   **Example:** The `Alert` component, which uses `composes` in its CSS to inherit base styles and then applies its own overrides.

3.  **Custom Component (from Scratch):**
    *   **What it is:** A completely new component built when no existing Digdir component meets our requirements.
    *   **When to use:** For unique UI patterns or functionality not covered by the base library.
    *   **Example:** The `DateInput` component is a custom component with its own state, logic, and styling.

## Component File Structure

To maintain consistency, every new component should follow this file structure. Create a new folder under `src/components/` with the component's `PascalCase` name.

```text
src/
└── components/
    └── MyNewComponent/
        ├── index.ts                 // Public API - exports the component and props
        ├── MyNewComponent.tsx       // The React component logic and JSX
        ├── MyNewComponent.stories.tsx // Storybook stories for documentation
        ├── styles.module.css        // Scoped CSS (only for custom components)
        └── MyNewComponent.test.tsx  // (Optional but Recommended) Unit tests
```

## Coding Guidelines

### 1. Component Logic (`MyNewComponent.tsx`)

*   **TypeScript First:** All components must be written in TypeScript. Define a `Props` interface for your component, extending from the base HTML element or Digdir component props if applicable.
*   **Forward Refs:** Always use `React.forwardRef` to allow parent components to get a `ref` to the underlying DOM element.
*   **Accessibility is Mandatory:**
    *   Use semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<label>`, `<nav>`).
    *   Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard-focusable and operable.
    *   Provide `aria-label` for icon-only buttons or elements where the text label is not visible.
    *   Use `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, etc., to communicate state to assistive technologies.
*   **Controlled vs. Uncontrolled:** If your component has state (like an input), it should support both controlled (`value` + `onChange`) and uncontrolled (`defaultValue`) patterns.
*   **Props Naming:** Use `data-*` attributes for styling variants (e.g., `data-size`, `data-color`) to align with the patterns in our existing components.

### 2. Styling (`styles.module.css`)

*   **CSS Modules:** For **custom components**, all styles must be placed in a `styles.module.css` file. This scopes class names locally and prevents global style conflicts.
*   **Design Tokens:** Always use our design system tokens (`var(--ds-...)`) for colors, spacing, fonts, etc. Do not use hardcoded values (e.g., `#FFF`, `16px`).
*   **Overriding Wrapped Components:** For **wrapped components**, use a standard CSS file. Use the `@layer` and `composes` keywords to extend base Digdir styles without increasing CSS specificity unnecessarily.

### 3. Documentation (`MyNewComponent.stories.tsx`)

Your Storybook file is the official documentation. It must be clear and comprehensive.

*   **`meta` Object:** Define the component's title, component reference, and `tags: ['autodocs']` to enable automatic documentation.
*   **`argTypes`:** Document every single prop. Provide a `description`, `control` type (e.g., `select`, `boolean`, `text`), and `options` if applicable. This powers the interactive controls in Storybook.
*   **Create Multiple Stories:** Create a separate story for each key state and variant of your component (e.g., `Default`, `Disabled`, `WithError`, `WithIcon`).

## Contribution Process

### 1. Create a Pull Request (PR)

1.  **Create a Branch:** Pull the latest changes from the `main` branch and create a new feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-new-component`.

2.  **Open a Draft PR:** As soon as you start, open a **draft** pull request on GitHub. This prevents duplicate work and allows others to see what you're working on.

3.  **Commit Your Changes:** As you work, make small, logical commits.

4.  **Ready for Review:** When development is complete and all automated checks are passing, mark the PR as "Ready for review" and request a review from the design system maintainers.
